speicification"> Isn't she lovely</a><p>

Isn't she wonderfull<p>

Isn't she precious<p>

Less than one minute old<p>

I never thought through love we'd be<p>

Making one as lovely as she<p>

But isn't she lovely made from love<p>

Isn't she pretty<p>

Truly the angel's best<p>

Boy, I'm so happy<p>

We have been heaven blessed<p>

I can't believe what God has done<p>
through us he's given life to one<p>

But isn't she lovely made from love<p>

Isn't she lovely<p>

Life and love are the same<p>

Life is Aisha<p>

The meaning of her name<p>

Londie, it could have not been done<p>
Without you who conceived the one<p>

That's so very lovely made from love<p>
